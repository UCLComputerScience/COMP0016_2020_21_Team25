            <h1>Gathering<br>Requirements</h1>
            <p>This section outlines our process of gathering requirements for the
                project. Upon being introduced to the project, we went through
                multiple phases of requirement gathering. We began by interviewing
                our clients to get a deeper understanding of what they expect from
                the service we would create. Upon completion, we then set out to
                interview our potential users to gain an understanding of what they
                expect from our system.

        <h2>Project Background</h2>
        <p>The IBM FISE portfolio of projects strives to reduce loneliness in the elderly. Due to current circumstances,
            and the application of self-isolation and social distancing guidelines, this issue has been worsened. For
            many, technology offered a way to overcome the challenges imposed by these guidelines. Services such as
            online shopping or video calls were able to replace in-person activities. However, for some, these services
            were confusing to access and to utilise. In particular, the elderly were found to struggle the most.</p>
        <p>The IBM FISE v2 Concierge aims to solve this by providing an easy to use, speech-controlled virtual
            assistant. This virtual assistant will be made available through an app that users will be able to download.
            The virtual assistant will offer a range of functionality such as the ability to place phone calls to loved
            ones or more general services such as checking the weather.</p>

        <h2>Gathering Requirements</h2>
        <p>To better understand our clients' expectations, we arranged a meeting with them at the beginning of our
            project. During this meeting, we asked them a series of questions so that we could gain an understanding of
            what their requirements for the project were. Their responses would help to generate our MoSCoW list. Below
            are some of the questions (and answers) asked to our two clients.</p>
        <div class="interview-container centred">
            <div class="card">
                <p class="question">What is the overall aim of the system?</p>
                <i class="answer">
                    <ion-icon name="chevron-forward-outline"></ion-icon>
                    To create a concierge service that makes it easier to access services from home.</i>

                <p class="question">How would you describe the system?</p>
                <i class="answer">
                    <ion-icon name="chevron-forward-outline"></ion-icon>
                    It is an easy to use system that would be similar to having a butler. </i>

                <p class="question">Who is the target audience for the system?</p>
                <i class="answer">
                    <ion-icon name="chevron-forward-outline"></ion-icon>
                    It should be targeted towards the elderly and less computer literate individuals.</i>

                <p class="question">What is the motivation behind the system?</p>
                <i class="answer">
                    <ion-icon name="chevron-forward-outline"></ion-icon>
                    To help the elderly and less computer literate individuals deal with the problems of social
                    isolation.</i>

                <p class="question">Compared to existing systems, how will this system be different?</p>
                <i class="answer">
                    <ion-icon name="chevron-forward-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Our system will be simpler and have more focused functionality.</i>

                <i class="answer">
                    <ion-icon name="chevron-forward-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Mobile Devices</i>

                <p class="question">Are there any other systems our system will need to interact with?</p>
                <i class="answer">
                    <ion-icon name="chevron-forward-outline"></ion-icon>
                    The organisation will be able to implement their services into our system via APIs.</i>

                <p class="question">Are there any data security requirements for the system?</p>
                <i class="answer">
                    <ion-icon name="chevron-forward-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Yes. We would like it if speech processing was done locally.</i>

        <h2>User Interviews</h2>
        <p>Once we had a better idea of the needs of our clients, we conducted interviews with potential end-users to
            see what they would expect from our system. We elected to give our potential elderly users a questionnaire
            as this would allow them to answer questions at their own pace. For the admin users, we elected to use
            semi-structured interviews to gather requirements as each user would have different needs, and we would need
            to be able to probe appropriately. Below are samples from a questionnaire with an elderly user (<b>left</b>)
            and an interview with potential admin users (<b>right</b>).</p>

                    Less than 1 hour a day.</i>

                <p class="question">Which of these online services do you frequently use:
                    <i>online shopping, online banking, checking the weather, other</i>?</p>

                <i class="answer">
                    <ion-icon name="chevron-forward-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Yes - they both regularly shop online using Amazon and, they also utilise online banking.</i>

                <p class="question">Have they ever had difficulties using these?</p>
                <i class="answer">
                    <ion-icon name="chevron-forward-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Yes, I occasionally get a call from them asking for help.</i>

                <p class="question">Do you think they would find a virtual assistant, such as Alexa, useful?</p>
                <i class="answer">
                    <ion-icon name="chevron-forward-outline"></ion-icon>
                    I think they would find it useful, but some of Alexa's features can be a bit complicated which they
                    could struggle using.</i>

                <p class="question">What are your opinions on a virtual assistant service designed for your parents
                    which you could manage remotely?</p>
                <i class="answer">
                    <ion-icon name="chevron-forward-outline"></ion-icon>
                    I think it sounds like a good idea. It would make both our lives easier. They could enjoy the
                    benefits of a virtual assistant and, if they run into issues, it would be much easier for me to help
                    them.</i>

                <p class="question">What features would you like when it comes to managing your parents' virtual
                    assistants?</p>
                <i class="answer">
                    <ion-icon name="chevron-forward-outline"></ion-icon>
                    I would like to be able to see how they interact with the virtual assistant, so some sort of log
                    would be useful. I would also like to be able to check in on them directly through the system in the
                    case of an emergency.</i>

                    pandemic. He is aware of speech recognition but has little to no experience using it. However,
                    knowing it'll be easier to conduct tasks using his voice, Bob is open to trying it out. He,
                    therefore, opens the app to do something he does a lot: check his bank balance; he opens the app and
                    clicks on the button to activate speech recognition. He then says his command, "what's my bank
                    balance?" which is transcribed to the screen. The app (locally) processes the request and shows him
                    his bank balance. Bob was therefore easily able to do something technical with minimal effort making
                    it easier to conduct digital tasks.​ ​</p>

                    difficult. Tim suggests to his parents to get the Concierge app. He can quickly set up accounts for

                    setting up the app; he enables some services for his parents to use. After a few days, his parents
                    ask Tim if they can have access to the food delivery service. He quickly logs on and enables it with
