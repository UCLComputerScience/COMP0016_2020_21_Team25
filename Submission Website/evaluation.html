        <h2>Bug List</h2>
        <p>Given the size of our project, we could not rely on peer review to uncover issues with another group member's
            code - we had too much to do on our own. Instead, we aimed to only push code to the repository once it was heavily manually and automatically
            tested.</p>
        <p>When we began to integrate our project, we used the GitHub issue tracker to keep track of bugs and fixing
            progress.</p>
        <p>Now that the project is complete, we can say there are no (known) bugs in our system but some may arise in
            the technology used, which is completely out of our control.</p>
        <p>Below is a screenshot of the GitHub issues tab, taken on Friday 26<sup>th</sup> March 2020 @ 12:10pm.</p>

        <h3>Admin Web App</h3>
        <p>The admin web app does not have any bugs but may have slight latency due to the fact that our cloud database
            is hosted in Dallas (as the London-based IBM DB2 servers were completely down during development).</p>
        <h3>Android App</h3>
        <p>The app itself does not have any bugs per say - all functionality works correctly. However, there were a
            few bugs with the
            technology we used to develop the app which may be worth discussing.</p>
        <h4>1. Android Studio Bugs</h4>
        <p>There were a few bugs with Android Studio. For example, with regards to tests, running all the unit tests
            together causes them all to fail,
            but running them individually works. Also, the instrumentation tests fail for no reason if
            ANDROID_TEST_ORCHESTRATOR is used, as specified in the
            Testing section. Also, when doing a gradle build and installing it on a device from Android Studio, it
            sometimes displayed error messages, again for no reason.
            Building the app and installing it again often solved the issue, however sometimes the entire cache had
            to be cleared by going under File
            and clicking Invalidate Caches/Restart. In some cases the errors would not stop the build/installation
            and in some cases it did. It should be made clear
            that there was no issue with our code (purely an Android Studio bug) as proven by the fact that simply
            building the project/clearing cache solved the issue</p>
        <h4>2. Fetching user's location (latitude and longitude) using Google...</h4>
        <p>For some reason, this only seems to work if location data for the user already exists (if they have used
            Google maps already then it would exist).
            Manually requesting the user's location from Android also did not seem to work. It is not possible for
            us to ascertain the user's location ourselves
            as this in itself would be its own project (a dedicated program would be needed).</p>
        <h4>3. Alarm Timings</h4>
        <p>Depending on the Android API Level, if a user sets an alarm, it may not go off on the exact time they
            set. Again, as we are using built in Android
            APIs to set notifications, if the alarm does not go off on the exact time there is little we can do
            about it as we are limited to the capabilities
            of the user's Android SDK version. If the API level is above 19, the alarm should go off on the exact
            time.</p>
