		<h2>Bugs</h2>
		<div>
		<h3>App</h3>
		<p>The app itself does not have any bugs per say - all functionality works correctly. However, there were a few bugs with the 
		technology we used to develop the app which may be worth discussing.</p>
		<h4>1. Android Studio Bugs</h4>
		<p>There were a few bugs with Android Studio. For example, with regards to tests, running all the unit tests together causes them all to fail,
		but running them individually works. Also, the instrumentation tests fail for no reason if ANDROID_TEST_ORCHESTRATOR is used, as specified in the
		Testing section. Also, when doing a gradle build and installing it on a device from Android Studio, it sometimes displayed error messages, again for no reason.
		Building the app and installing it again often solved the issue, however sometimes the entire cache had to be cleared by going under File 
		and clicking Invalidate Caches/Restart. In some cases the errors would not stop the build/installation and in some cases it did. It should be made clear
		that there was no issue with our code (purely an Android Studio bug) as proven by the fact that simply building the project/clearing cache solved the issue</p>
		<h4>2. Fetching user's location (latitude and longitude) using Google...</h4>
		<p>For some reason, this only seems to work if location data for the user already exists (if they have used Google maps already then it would exist). 
		Manually requesting the user's location from Android also did not seem to work. It is not possible for us to ascertain the user's location ourselves
		as this in itself would be its own project (a dedicated program would be needed).</p>
		<h4>3. Alarm Timings</h4>
		<p>Depending on the Android API Level, if a user sets an alarm, it may not go off on the exact time they set. Again, as we are using built in Android
		APIs to set notifications, if the alarm does not go off on the exact time there is little we can do about it as we are limited to the capabilities
		of the user's Android SDK version. If the API level is above 19, the alarm should go off on the exact time.</p>
