        <h2>Research Overview</h2>
        <p>Our project was to develop a virtual assistant service for elderly users as
            part of IBM FISE v2 Concierge. This service should be available in the form
            of an app which utilises speech as its main mode of interaction and should
            help users in their daily lives. The app should support a range of features
            which should be implemented using RESTFUL APIs.</p>

        <p>Alongside the app, we would also need an Admin website which is intended to
            be used by the elderly users loved ones. This website would be used to setup
            an elderly user’s app, enable access to specific features of the app and view
            logs containing details about the elderly user’s interactions with the app.</p>

        <p>Finally, we would also need a backend to support both the app and the website.
            This backend would be responsible for data storage.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left">To summarise, we spent time researching the following areas:</p>

        <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
        <p>Part of our research involved finding products similar to ours to see if we could
            learn anything from them that may aid us in development. We found two similar
            products Dalia and Alfred.</p>
        <div class="centred">
            <div class="centred">
                <h3>Dalia</h3>
                <p>Dalia is a virtual assistant specifically for the elderly which aims to
                    serve a remarkably similar purpose as our intended solution. However,
                    it seems development has ceased (no updates to their app or website
                    since 2016) and it seems to be completely centred around the (tracking
                    of) physical health of its users. We aim to provide a more general 
                    solution.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="centred">
                <h3>Alfred</h3>
                <p>Like Dalia, Alfred is another virtual assistant for the elderly.
                    However, it again seems to be focused on the physical health of
                    the user, mainly trying to get them to be more active through games
                    and exercises. Additionally, it also seems that development has 
                    stopped, and the project is inactive at the time of writing.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style="width: 100%;">Unfortunately, we weren’t able to learn much from these
            products due to both of them currently being inactive and incomplete.</p>

        <h2>App Frontend</h2>
        <p>Before we could begin production on the app, we would have to evaluate
            what platforms we would like to develop the app for and what framework and
            language we would utilise. There are two main mobile operating systems we
            had to consider, <b>iOS (Apple)</b> and <b>Android (Google)</b>.
            As such we considered three possible frameworks.</p>
        <div class="centred">
            <h3>NativeScript</h3>
            <p>NativeScript is a relatively new framework which was released in 2014
                for the development of apps for iOS and Android. NativeScript apps are
                built using JavaScript or any other programming language that
                translate to JavaScript (e.g Vue and Angular).</p>
            <p>NativeScript would provide the following advantages if we were to
                develop with it:</p>
            <ul class="centred">
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Can create apps for both mobile operating systems from
                    the same code base - reduced development time
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Built in speech recognition and speech synthesis (which can
                    support multiple languages)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Familiarity as our team already has experience with Vue
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, there were also key disadvantages with NativeScript:</p>

            <ul class="centred">
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="close"></ion-icon>
                    Development environment dependent on Xcode which is only
                    available on MacBook (if you want to develop for iOS)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="close"></ion-icon>
                    Overshadowed by React Native so less available
                    resources should we run into difficulties
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="centred">
            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language. It can be used to
                write apps for Googles Android OS. Android Studio is the official IDE
                created by Google for developing apps for Android it was released in
                2014 as a replacement to the previous Android Development tool.
                It is designed specifically for the creation of Android apps and
                provides many useful tools to aid in development.</p>
            <p>Android Studio would provide the following advantages if we
                were to develop with it:</p>
            <ul class="centred">
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Built in speech recognition and synthesis (which can support
                    multiple languages)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Specifically designed for Android so greater control over the

                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, there were also disadvantages with Java & Android Studio:</p>

            <ul class="centred">
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="close"></ion-icon>
                    We would develop only for Android as there would not be
                    sufficient time to develop for iOS as well

            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="centred">
            <h3>Swift</h3>
            <p>Swift is a general purpose compiled programming language developed by
                Apple and released in 2014. It was created to replace Objective C
                which had previously been used by Apple for all its products.
                It is included in Xcode which is Apple's official IDE for developing
                apps for all their platforms but in this case, we are interested in
                its uses for iOS development.</p>
            <p>Swift would provide the following advantages if we
                were to develop with it:</p>
            <ul class="centred">
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Designed for development on Apple's operating system so greater
                    control over the device and its built-in features

                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>

                    Supports most Java libraries
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, there were also key disadvantages with Swift:</p>

                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="close"></ion-icon>
                    We would develop only for iOS as there would be

        <p style="padding-top: 24px">
            For this project we selected to utilise Java as our development language
            and therefore develop only for Android. While we initially considered
            NativeScript, its dependency on Xcode for its development environment
            eliminated it as not all of us utilise MacBooks for development those
            without would be unable to run their code. We also asked to client on
            their opinions about this decision and they did not object to it.</p>

        <h2>Admin Website Frontend</h2>
        <p>As mentioned above the Admin website will be used by elderly users loved
            ones to register users, provide selective access to the apps features and
            view activity logs.</p>

        <p>To create this website, we considered two possible
            frameworks: <b>Vue.js</b> and <b>React</b>. The reason we focused on
            these two frameworks
            was because they both utilise the concept of the <b>Virtual DOM</b> (Document
            Object Model). The Virtual DOM is an abstraction of the HTML DOM which is
            a tree structure of nodes which are HTML elements. When creating interactive
            websites with HTML DOM this would result in having to re render the entire
            page when an element changes. The advantage of utilising a Virtual DOM is
            that only the objects that change would need to be re-rendered. This saves
            time and resources and is especially useful on more interactive websites
            (such as ours) which need to update frequently.</p>

        <div class="research-container centred">
            <div class="centred">
                <h3>Vue.js</h3>
                <p>Vue.js is a JavaScript framework designed for building user
                    interfaces. It was created in 2014 and aimed to extract parts of
                    AngularJS to make a more lightweight framework. It is available
                    to use and develop with under an open-source license.</p>
                <p>Were we to
                    develop the admin website using Vue.js it would provide the
                    following benefits:</p>
                <ul class="centred">

                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                        Easy to develop with due to its clear structure

                        The Vue.js community is much smaller than that of React

            For this component of the project, we elected to utilise Vue.js.
            The main reasoning behind this was that it was easy to learn and
            develop in while still being able to produce high quality results.
            We valued this highly as our project has many components that need to
            be built and given our strict time allowance a faster development period
            would ensure our ability to complete all components.</p>

        <h2>System Backend</h2>
        <p>To support our app and our website we also require a backend.
            This backend will be responsible for storing and manipulating data
            generated by the users and relaying back where appropriate.</p>
        <p>The backend will also be responsible for placing appropriate API calls
            from the application and then relaying the relevant information. For our
            backend we considered two potential languages to code with: <b>Python</b> and
            <b>Java</b>.</p>
        <p>These are the languages we considered as they are the most popular
            backend development languages and we all had prior experience with them.</p>

                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>Python is an interpreted general-purpose programming language. It
                    was released in 1991 continuously developed since. It is supported
                    by a wide range of devices. Python has a very straight forward and
                    easy to understand syntax that can be very flexible and used for a
                    variety of purposes.</p>
                <p>If we were to use Python to develop our backend, it would offer
                    the following advantages:</p>
                <ul class="centred">
                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                        Simple syntax so it would be straightforward and quick to use
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                        Very popular so there are plenty of resources online for us to utilise
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                        Has access to a large collection of libraries
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                        Familiarity as our team already has experience with Python
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>However, there were also key disadvantages with NativeScript:</p>

                <ul class="centred">
                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="close"></ion-icon>
                        Python is a lot slower when compared to a lot of languages
                        such as C, even Java
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="close"></ion-icon>
                        Python can have high memory consumption depending on the task
                    </li>

            </div>

            <div class="centred">
                <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>Java is a compiled object-oriented programming language. It was
                    released in 1995 and, like Python, has been continuously developed
                    since. Java can be run on most machines due to its use of the JVM
                    which gives it platform independence. Java syntax is not as simple
                    as Pythons but that would not be an issue for us as we all have
                    existing experience with Java.</p>
                <p>If we were to use Java to develop our backend, it would provide
                    the following advantages:</p>
                <ul class="centred">
                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                        Large amount of code reusability due to OOP approach which would
                        speed up development
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                        Faster than Python due to it being compiled
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                        Extensive collection of libraries
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                        Familiarity as our team already has experience with Java
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>However, there were also disadvantages with Java & Android Studio:</p>

                <ul class="centred">
                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="close"></ion-icon>
                        More syntactically verbose than Python - increased development time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="close"></ion-icon>
                        Slow compared to other language such as C
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p style="padding-top: 24px">
            For the backend of our project, we decided to utilise Python.
            This is because of the two options we believe Python is the easier to
            work with and will result in a faster production of code. This is mainly
            due to Pythons much simpler syntax which allows us to do more with fewer
            lines of code. As mentioned previously time is a key resource in our project
            and we want to conserve as much of it as possible.</p>
