        <h2>Research Overview</h2>
        <p>Our project was to develop a virtual assistant service for elderly users as
            part of IBM FISE v2 Concierge. This service will be available in the form
            of an app which utilises speech as its primary mode of interaction and should
            help users in their daily lives. The app should support a range of features,
            implemented using RESTFUL APIs.</p>

        <p>Alongside the app, we would also need an Admin website which will
            be used by the elderly user's loved ones. The website is used to set up
            an elderly user’s app, enable access to specific features of the app and view
            logs containing details about the elderly user’s interactions with the app.</p>

        <p>Finally, we would also need a backend to support both the app and the website.
            This backend would be responsible for data storage.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left">To summarise, we spent time researching the following areas:</p>

        <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
        <p>Part of our research involved finding products similar to ours to see if we could
            learn anything from them that may aid us in development. We found two similar
            products, Dalia and Alfred.</p>
        <div class="centred">
            <div class="centred">
                <h3>Dalia</h3>
                <p>Dalia is a virtual assistant specifically for the elderly serving
                    a remarkably similar purpose as our intended solution. However,
                    it seems development has ceased (no updates to their app or website
                    since 2016) and it appears to focus on the (tracking
                    of) physical health of its users. We aim to provide a more general 
                    solution.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="centred">
                <h3>Alfred</h3>
                <p>Like Dalia, Alfred is another virtual assistant for the elderly.
                    However, it again seems to be focused on the physical health of
                    the user, mainly trying to get them to be more active through games
                    and exercises. Additionally, it also seems that development has 
                    stopped, and the project is inactive at the time of writing.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style="width: 100%;">Unfortunately, we were not able to learn much from these
            products due to both of them currently being inactive and incomplete.</p>

        <h2>App Frontend</h2>
        <p>Before we could begin production on the app, we would have to evaluate
            what platforms we would like to develop the app for and what framework and
            language we would utilise. There are two leading mobile operating systems we
            had to consider, <b>iOS (Apple)</b> and <b>Android (Google)</b>.
            As such, we researched and considered three possible frameworks.</p>
        <div class="centred">
            <h3>NativeScript</h3>
            <p>NativeScript is a relatively new framework, released in 2014,
                for the development of apps for iOS and Android. NativeScript apps are
                developed using JavaScript or any other programming language that
                translates to JavaScript (e.g. <b>Vue</b> and <b>Angular</b>).</p>
            <p>NativeScript would provide the following advantages if we were to
                develop with it:</p>
            <ul class="centred">
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Can create apps for both mobile operating systems from
                    the same code base - reduced development time
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Built-in speech recognition and speech synthesis (which can
                    support multiple languages)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Familiarity as our team already has experience with Vue
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, there were also fundamental disadvantages with NativeScript:</p>

            <ul class="centred">
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="close"></ion-icon>
                    Development environment dependent on Xcode which is only
                    available on MacBook (if you want to develop for iOS)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="close"></ion-icon>
                    Overshadowed by React Native so less available
                    resources should we run into difficulties
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="centred">
            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language. It can be used to
                develop apps for Googles Android OS. Android Studio is the official IDE
                created by Google for developing apps for Android and released in
                2014 as a replacement to the previous Android Development tool.
                It is designed specifically for the creation of Android apps and
                provides many useful tools to aid in development.</p>
            <p>Android Studio would provide the following advantages if we
                were to develop with it:</p>
            <ul class="centred">
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Built-in speech recognition and synthesis (which can support
                    multiple languages)

                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Specifically designed for Android so greater control over the

                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>

                    A large amount of extensive and detailed documentation
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, there were also disadvantages with Java & Android Studio:</p>

            <ul class="centred">
                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="close"></ion-icon>
                    We would develop only for Android as there would not be
                    sufficient time to develop for iOS as well
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="centred">
            <h3>Swift</h3>
            <p>Swift is a general-purpose compiled programming language developed by
                Apple and released in 2014. It was designed to replace Objective C,
                previously been used by Apple for all its products.
                It is included in Xcode - Apple's official IDE for developing
                apps for all their platforms but in this case, we are interested in
                its uses for iOS development.</p>
            <p>Swift would provide the following advantages if we
                were to develop with it:</p>

                <li>
                    <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                    Built-in speech recognition and speech synthesis (which can

                    Supports most Java libraries
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, there were also fundamental disadvantages with Swift:</p>

            <ul class="centred">

                    <ion-icon name="close"></ion-icon>
                    We would develop only for iOS as there would be
                    insufficient time to develop for Android as well

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p style="padding-top: 32px">
            For this project, we selected to utilise Java as our development language
            and therefore develop only for Android. While we initially considered
            NativeScript, its dependency on Xcode for its development environment
            eliminated it as not all of us utilise MacBooks for development those
            without would be unable to run their code. We also asked the client on
            their opinions about this decision who did not object to it.</p>

        <h2>Admin Website Frontend</h2>
        <p>As mentioned above the Admin website will be used by elderly users loved
            ones to register users, provide selective access to the apps features and
            view activity logs.</p>

        <p>To create this website, we considered two possible
            frameworks: <b>Vue.js</b> and <b>React</b>. The reason we focused on
            these two frameworks was that they both utilise the concept of the
            <b>Virtual DOM</b> (Document Object Model). The Virtual DOM is an
            abstraction of the HTML DOM which is
            a tree structure of nodes which are HTML elements. When creating interactive
            websites with the standard HTML DOM, this would result in having to
            re-render the entire
            page when an HTML element changes. The advantage of utilising a Virtual DOM is
            that only the objects that change would need to be re-rendered; this saves
            time and (processing) resources and is especially useful on more
            interactive websites (such as ours) which need to update frequently.</p>

        <div class="research-container centred">
            <div class="centred">
                <h3>Vue.js</h3>
                <p>Vue.js is a JavaScript framework designed for building user
                    interfaces. It was created in 2014 and aimed to extract parts of
                    AngularJS to make a more lightweight framework. It is available
                    to use and develop with under an open-source license.</p>
                <p>Were we to
                    develop the admin website using Vue.js it would provide the

                        The Vue.js community is much smaller than that of React

            For this component of the project, we elected to utilise Vue.js.
            The main reasoning behind this was that it was easy to learn and
            develop with while still being able to produce high-quality results.
            We valued this highly as our project has many components that need to
            be built and given our strict time constraints, a faster development period
            would ensure our ability to implement all system components.</p>

        <h2>System Backend</h2>
        <p>We also require a backend to support the app and admin website.
            This backend will be responsible for storing and manipulating data
            generated by the users and relaying back where appropriate.</p>
        <p>The backend will also be responsible for placing appropriate API calls
            from the application and then relaying the relevant information. For our
            backend, we considered two potential languages to code with <b>Python</b> and
            <b>Java</b>.</p>
        <p>These are the languages we considered as they are the most popular
            backend development languages, and, we all had prior experience with them.</p>

                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>Python is an interpreted general-purpose programming language. Released
                    in 1991 and continuously developed since Python is supported by a wide
                    range of devices. Python has a very straight forward and
                    easy to understand syntax that can be very flexible and used for a
                    variety of purposes.</p>
                <p>If we were to use Python to develop our backend, it would offer

                        Python is a lot slower when compared to a lot of languages

                <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>Java is a compiled object-oriented programming language. Released in 1995
                    and, like Python, has been continuously developed
                    since. Java can run on most machines due to its use of the JVM,
                    giving it superior platform independence. Java syntax is not as simple
                    as Python's - this is a non-issue as we all have
                    prior experience with Java.</p>

            For the backend of our project, we decided to utilise Java.
            This is because of the two options we believe that the advantages Java
            offered outweighed those offered by Python. For starters, speed is important
            as long load times can have a large negative affect on the usability of both our
            app and our admin website. Secondly, we are all familiar with Java and as such our rate
            production of code is unlikely to be greatly affected even though Python is the
            syntactically easier language to use. Finally, in this context we value the
            decreased memory consumption of Java as the backend is intended to be run locally and
            as such it should be resource light so that it can be more accessible.

        <h2>Voice Assistant</h2>
        <p>One of the highlights of our system will be the voice assistant within the Concierge App.
            This voice assistant will utilise natural language processing to decode a user’s command
            such that users will have an increased amount of freedom of expression.</p>
        <p>
            When it comes to natural language processing, Python is the go-to language due
            to its expensive array of libraries, especially with regards to machine learning.
            For our NLP library of choice, we considered two options: Spacy and RASA.</p>

        <div class="research-container centred">
            <div class="centred">
                <h3>Spacy</h3>
                <p>Spacy is an advanced natural language processing library focused on creating
                    NLP algorithms which are for production usage. Spacy utilises convolutional
                    neural network models that allow it to perform speech tagging, tokenizing
                    and named entity recognition
                </p>
                <p>If we were to use Spacy to develop our voice assistant, it would offer
                    the following advantages:</p>

                        <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                        Speed. Spacy is faster than Rasa

                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                        Less rigid than Rasa, making it easier to mold to a specific use case

                        <ion-icon name="close"></ion-icon>
                        It can be difficult and time consuming to write training data for Spacy

                    <li>
                        <ion-icon name="close"></ion-icon>
                        Is more complex to work with than Rasa

            <div class="centred">
                <h3>Rasa</h3>
                <p>Rasa is a natural language processing framework designed specifically for
                    building contextual voice assistants. Rasa builds upon Spacy and abstracts
                    some of the complexities of machine learning. It provides many of the same
                    features as Spacy such as name entity recognition or tokenizing.

        <p style="padding-top: 32px">
            For our app's voice assistant we elected to utilise Spacy. The main factor behind this
            decision was speed. As mentioned above speed plays an important part in the system as
            it can drastically impact usablity and lower the standard of a users experience. While speed
            was the main factor considered in this decision, Spacy's increased flexibility was also
            considered as it would give us greater customisation over the voice assistant and its capabilities.
