        <h2>Research Overview</h2>
        <p>Our project was to develop a virtual assistant service for elderly users as
            part of IBM FISE v2 Concierge. This service should be available in the form
            of an app which utilises speech as its main mode of interaction and should
            help users in their daily lives. The app should support a range of features
            which should be implemented using RESTFUL APIs.</p>

        <p> Alongside the app, we would also need an Admin website which is intended to
            be used by the elderly users loved ones. This website would be used to setup
            an elderly user’s app, enable access to specific features of the app and view
            logs containing details about the elderly user’s interactions with the app.</p>

        <p> Finally, we would also need a backend to support both the app and the website.
            This backend would be responsible for data storage.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left">To summarise, we spent time researching the following areas:</p>

        <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
        <p>Part of our research involved finding products similar to ours to see if we could
            learn anything from them that may aid us in development. We found two similar
            products Dalia and Alfred.</p>
        <div class="centred">
            <div class="centred">
                <h3>Dalia</h3>
                <p>Dalia is a virtual assistant specifically for the elderly which aims to
                    serve a remarkably similar purpose as our intended solution. However,
                    it seems development has ceased (no updates to their app or website
                    since 2016) and it seems to be completely centred around the (tracking
                    of) physical health of its users. We aim to provide a more general 
                    solution.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="centred">
                <h3>Alfred</h3>
                <p>Like Dalia, Alfred is another virtual assistant for the elderly.
                    However, it again seems to be focused on the physical health of
                    the user, mainly trying to get them to be more active through games
                    and exercises. Additionally, it also seems that development has 
                    stopped, and the project is inactive at the time of writing.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style="width: 100%;">Unfortunately, we weren’t able to learn much from these
            products due to both of them currently being inactive and incomplete. </p>

    <section id="app-research" class="centred">
        <h2>App Frontend</h2>
        <p>Before we could begin production on the app, we would have to evaluate
            what platforms we would like to develop the app for and what framework and
            language we would utilise. There are two main mobile operating systems we
            had to consider, <b>iOS (Apple)</b> and <b>Android (Google)</b>.
            As such we considered three possible frameworks.</p>
        <div class="centred">
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="web-frontend" class="light-page-section centred">
        <h2>Admin Website Frontend</h2>
        <p>As mentioned above the Admin website will be used by elderly users loved
            ones to register users, provide selective access to the apps features and
            view activity logs.</p>

        <p>To create this website, we considered two possible
            frameworks: <b>Vue.js</b> and <b>React</b>. The reason we focused on
            these two frameworks
            was because they both utilise the concept of the <b>Virtual DOM</b> (Document
            Object Model). The Virtual DOM is an abstraction of the HTML DOM which is
            a tree structure of nodes which are HTML elements. When creating interactive
            websites with HTML DOM this would result in having to re render the entire
            page when an element changes. The advantage of utilising a Virtual DOM is
            that only the objects that change would need to be re-rendered. This saves
            time and resources and is especially useful on more interactive websites
            (such as ours) which need to update frequently.</p>
