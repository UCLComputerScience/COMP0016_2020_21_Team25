                <h3>Design Principles</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>MVC Design Principle</h4>
                        <p>Given that the app will have a UI, database interactions and functionality, the MVC
                            architecture was
                            a
                            natural fit for the app,
                            where the UI will be managed by classes under the 'views' package, database queries and
                            structure
                            through classes in the 'model' package
                            and functionality through classes under the 'controllers' package. See the architecture
                            diagram for
                            a
                            visual representation of this.
                        </p>
                        <p> The MVC architecture also makes it easier for developers to expand on and
                            use existing functionality. For example, if they add a new feature that requires opening a
                            URL,
                            they
                            can just use the openUrl method in MainController
                            to do this without ever needing to understanding how this is done or implemented, hence
                            abstracting
                            away
                            the existing complexity of the code and system.
                        </p>
                        <p> Aside from this, no other design principle was employed. This was because code was split
                            across over
                            80
                            classes each of which was very different from the next.
                            Even classes within the same packages would differ widely from each other containing vastly
                            different
                            methods taking different parameters and returning different
                            values. They also took different values in their constructors. This meant that the use of
                            design
                            patterns
                            would only over-complicate the system, defeating the
                            point of design patterns. However, other good programming practices were employed. See
                            details
                            below.

                    <li>
                        <h4>Separation of Concern Principle</h4>
                        <p>Using this principle, all code was split into logical packages, classes and methods.
                            Each class does one main thing. This ensures that
                            code
                            is cleaner, more readable and easier to understand.
                            This also made the code easier to test, debug and fix.

                    <li>
                        <h5>Singleton</h5>
                        <p>The main controller needs to be a singleton to ensure all object references to the main
                            controller in all parts of the app will have the same state </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Factory</h5>
                        <p>The main controller, being a singleton object, will be accessed through a factory object.</p>
                        <p>The main controller will be needed in different view controllers, as well as the service and
                            backend interaction, all of which do not have references to each other. </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h5>Adapter</h5>
                        <p>The data model converts data received from the backend into the form required by the main
                            controller (and vice versa).</p>

                        <p>The service API interaction converts JSON data received from an API into a set of English
                            sentences to be spoken aloud to the user. </p>

                <h4>Behavioural</h4>

                    <li>
                        <h5>Template</h5>
                        <p>Each service request object will extend an abstract service request object which builds the
                            HTTP response. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Command</h5>
                        <p>A service request object represents a HTTP request to a service and its information is passed
                            to a request handler object to build the URL query, perform the API request and return the
                            JSON data, also handling any HTTP errors. </p>
                    </li>

                <h4>Functional</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Stream API</h5>
                        <p>Several data structures were used for the app [see implementation] such as HashMaps and
                            ArrayLists. Rather than
                            implementing operations for these data structures ourselves, we used Stream API to bridge
                            the gap. This is a good
                            programming practise as it allowed for cleaner, more readable and more reliable code (given
                            that these stream pipeline
                            methods are well tested and maintained).</p>

        <p>All Activities are accessible from the home page (Main Activity). See details for each Activity below.</p>
        <p>All Activities use the constraint layout provided by Android as it provided strong control over the
            positioning of UI objects, more so than other
            layouts such as RelativeLayout. All errors on Activities were relayed to users through Toasts. Speech
            synthesis was also used where possible.
            To ensure the UI hierarchy was
            as clean, minimal and easy to navigate as possible, we did not provide access to Activities from other
            Activities unless necessary. We did provide 'BACK' buttons on each page
            to allows users to easily navigate back to the previous activity they were on. Each activity has a clear
            title to ensure the user knows which page they are on. </p>
        <h3>Main Activity</h3>
        <p>This activity was the main page where users could use the Concierge voice assisstant and navigate to all
            other pages. It was designed to be easy
            to use and allow the elderly to use the Voice Assistant easily.</p>
        <p>The activity contains a scrollable menu of all the available activities and comes with a custom scroll
            bar to make it clear to elderly users
            that this is a scrollable menu. This has many benefits. For example, buttons and their text can be
            bigger as we don't have to show all the buttons
            on the page. It also means that developers can easily add new activities and add their buttons to the
            scrollable menu without disrupting the existing
            UI.</p>
        <h3>ViewAlarms Activity</h3>
        <p>This activity allows user to view all their alarms in one place. We used the ListView to display all
            alarms to the user and added a custom
            scrollbar which means users can add as many alarms as they want and simply scroll through them should
            they exceed the screen height.
            This activity automatically queries the local db to see the alarms currently added by the user.
            From here, users can
            click on the 'ADD NEW ALARM' button which will take them to the AddAlarmActivity.</p>
        <h3>AddAlarm Activity</h3>
        <p>This activity allows users to add a new alarm by adding an alarm message, selecting a date using the
            datepicker widget, selecting a time using
            the timepicker widget and pressing 'SAVE'. The alarm will then be added to the local storage.
            Users will then be automatically taken back to the ViewAlarmsActivity where their alarm will now be
            displayed.</p>
        <h3>EditAlarm Activity</h3>
        <p>Users can tap on an existing alarm and will be taken to this activity where they can edit the alarm
            details, or instead, delete the alarm completely.
            Whether they save or delete, they will then be taken back to ViewAlarmsActivity automatically.</p>
        <h3>ViewReminders Activity</h3>
        <p>This activity allows user to view all their reminders in one place. We used the ListView to display all
            reminders to the user and added a custom
            scrollbar which means users can add as many reminders as they want and simply scroll through them should
            they exceed the screen height. This page
            automatically queries the local db to see the reminders currently added by the user.From here users can
            click on the 'ADD NEW REMINDER' button
            which will take them to the AddReminderActivity.</p>
        <h3>AddReminder Activity</h3>
        <p>This activity allows users to add a new reminder by adding a reminder message and pressing 'SAVE'. The
            reminder will then be added to the local storage.
            Users will then be taken back to the ViewRemindersActivity automatically where their reminder will now be
            displayed.</p>
        <h3>EditReminder Activity</h3>
        <p>Users can tap on an existing reminder and will be taken to this activity where they can edit the reminder
            details, or instead, delete the reminder completely.
            Whether they save or delete, they will then be taken back to ViewRemindersActivity automatically.</p>
        <h3>Timers Activity</h3>
        <p>Users can use the numberpicker widgets to set a timer. There are 3 numberwidegts, one for hours, one for
            minutes and one for seconds. When the user
            starts a timer, a 'PAUSE' button appears which they can use to pause the timer. Once they pause a timer,
            the original 'START' button will appear again
            which they can use to resume the timer from where it was paused.</p>
        <h3>History Activity</h3>
        <p>Users can view their last seven day history here. Their history is only shown for Service API
            requests. This activity also uses a ListView with
            our custom scroll bar, so no matter how long a user's seven day history is, they will be able to scroll
            through it all.</p>
        <h3>Register Activity</h3>
        <p>This activity is where users can enter their three registration codes to connect to their admin.</p>
        <h3>About Activity</h3>
        <p>This activity provides some information about the developers, clients and the product itself.</p>

        <h2>Admin Web App Architecture</h2>
        <p>Vue does away with specific view controllers in the Model-View-Controller design pattern meaning we will be
            following a Model-View pattern for the admin web app.</p>
        <div class="enlargeable diagram">
            <span>Click to enlarge</span>
            <img alt="Admin web app system architecture" src="assets/images/design/System%20Design%20-%20Admin.jpg">
            <img alt="Admin web app system architecture" src="assets/images/design/System%20Design%20-%20Admin.jpg"
                 tabindex="-1">
        </div>

        <p>Given that websites can be accessed via mobile devices, we will be employing the Mobile-First design
            principle. That is, we primarily design the website for mobile devices and then apply CSS media queries to
            take advantage of the extra space and functionalities (e.g., a more precise mouse) granted by tablets,
            desktops and laptops. </p>
        <h3>Views</h3>
        <p>A view will be comprised of several components, in line with the Vue design approach where each sub-component
            specifies its style, physical layout and methods. A component may be as general as a page container or as
            specific as a button to another page. Components can be comprised of several smaller sub-components. This
            approach promotes the reusability of components, leading to less duplicated code as well as abstracting the
            functionality of components from one another to make them less coupled with each other. This also allows for
            the interchange of components should our functionality, or design change during the implementation
            stage. </p>
        <h4>Welcome</h4>
        <p>This is the first page the user will see (if not logged in) with two sub-views containing separate forms for
            logging into an existing account and registering for a new one. </p>
        <p>If the user tries to access this page while signed in, they will be redirected to the <b>people</b> view.
        </p>
        <p>Note that users will always be automatically signed in if they have not manually logged out of their
            account.</p>
        <h4>People</h4>
        <p>This view where the admin manages the users in their circle. It is comprised of a sidebar, allowing the user
            to select and focus on one user at a time, and the following sub-views: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Manage</b> – allows the admin to modify the stored details of the selected user – this is the default
                sub-view of the people view.
            </li>
            <li><b>Services</b> – allows the admin to view and modify the data stored for each service currently added
                to the select user’s account. Services can also be removed here.
            </li>
            <li><b>Details</b> – displays the (full) service usage history for the selected user.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Marketplace</h4>
        <p>This view displays a grid of all available services, allowing the admin to search/filter the services to find
            the one they need. In this view, the admin chooses services to add to their circle of users. </p>
        <h4>Not Found</h4>
        <p>A standard 404 not found view indicates that there is no resource located on this page. From here, the user
            can only be redirected to the welcome view.</p>
        <h3>Backend Interaction</h3>
        <p>The main model object provides an interface to provide the necessary functions to (safely) access and modify
            data stored in the cloud database. Where necessary, the interface returns a string message representing the
            response; this can be used to display meaningful error messages to the users such as <i>“Your username or
                password was incorrect”</i> instead of silently failing. </p>

        <p>Since this main model is written in Java, we cannot directly call it from the Vue app. Instead, the backend
            will be a RESTful API, running on <b>localhost</b> and connected to the cloud database, and make API calls
            to it
            from both the web and Android app. The API will return the necessary responses from the main model. </p>
        <p>Each JSON response shares the following fields:</p>
        <pre>{
    "success": Boolean,
    "message": String,
    "code": Integer
}</pre>
        <p>Along with any other field returned by a specific endpoint.</p>
        <i>Note that <code>code</code> is the HTTP status code, defined by <a

            standard.</i>
        <h3>Data Models</h3>
        <p>The main model is an interface where the concrete implementation is comprised of many other models so the
            front-end does not need to be concerned with what model it needs to access to retrieve the needed data.
            These models include, but are not limited to, admin, user and service models. The models handle interaction
            with data regarding their corresponding entity. The functions of each sub-model will take in parameters and
            specify the necessary SQL commands to be performed on the database. </p>
        <p>There is a further abstraction between the main model (and its sub-models) and the database. The database is
            accessed via a database model which provides functions to query and execute commands on the database. It
            handles the connection to the database as well as any SQL/cloud errors that may occur; this decouples the
            models from the database, allowing us to easily switch to a different cloud hosting service should our
            storage/concurrent access requirements increase. </p>
        <p>The web app will also have its main model which provides an interface, specifying how to access the backend;
            this provides another layer of abstraction to allow our web app, API and
            backend to all work independently. </p>
        <p>While this highly abstracted approach does add an extra layer (the need for an API to handle the interaction
            between the frontend and the backend) to the design, it greatly reduces the coupling between the frontend
            and the backend; this allows us to alter (or even completely switch out) the operation of either layer if
            needed as well as allowing group members to work on either component without being concerned with how the
            other is working. </p>
