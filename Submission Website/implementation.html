        <h2>Admin Web App</h2>
        <p>The companion web app to the <b>IBM FISE Concierge</b> allowing friends of (elderly) users to set up
            accounts and manage the details of all members in their circle. Admins have the ability to add and
            remove services from member accounts and view service usage history for each member.</p>
        <div class="web-app-section centred">
            <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>The web app is designed to be usable on any device with a browser (with JavaScript enabled) and as such
                required care into ensuring it worked on any (modern) browser on any screen size and orientation. To
                facilitate this, the mobile-first design pattern was implemented using CSS – the styles for each
                component (button, header, input etc.) are designed to be usable on mobile devices. Once the appearance
                was up to standard, extra cases were added (using CSS media queries) to make use of the space afforded
                by larger devices.</p>

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>The web app must be user-friendly to all types of users, including those less able. To ensure this was
                true, standard HTML semantics were followed (e.g., using the <span
                >&lt;button&gt;</span> tag for buttons instead of div
                elements; splitting pages into section elements and ensuring headings followed the <i>h1, h2, h3</i>
                etc.
                pattern in order).</p>
            <p>This approach makes the website more screen reader friendly so more users can use the web app. Naturally,
                we are not experts on this, and our implementation is likely far from perfect, but accessibility was
                always kept in mind during the implementation phase.</p>

        <div class="web-app-section centred">
            <h3>Data Fetching</h3>
            <p>To communicate with the backend, the <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios" rel="noopener"
                                                       target="_blank">Axios</a> Node module was
                used to make RESTful API calls to the
                backend;
                this was then wrapped in a set of methods to act as a further abstraction between the backend and the
                frontend. Axios is a popular and mature library but should we want to switch to another data-fetching
                library, only the content of the wrapper methods needs to be changed- the frontend can remain the
                same.</p>
            <p>Given Vue’s reactive nature, the data provided on the website can be populated when it is ready (i.e.,
                returned by the backend). To facilitate this, JavaScript’s Promise API was used with asynchronous
                data-fetching methods.</p>
            <p>Naturally, API calls take some non-zero time to make and receive a response from – the website should not
                be frozen while waiting for this data otherwise it would completely hamper the user experience; this
                problem would worsen for users on slower internet connections.</p>
            <p>In essence, when performing an API call with the
                <code>axios.request()</code>
                method, the object returned is a <b>Promise</b>. A
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise"
                   rel="noopener"
                   target="_blank">Promise</a>
                is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation (Promise -
                JavaScript | MDN, 2021). The backend response was wrapped in a Promise (by the axios library) which
                resolves
                into the JSON response when the backend responds; this happens automatically, handled by the Promise
                API.</p>
            <p>As a result, we could make API calls and then set the required data when a response is received; once
                received, Vue’s reactive nature will then repaint the DOM to display this data.</p>
            <p>Naturally, some methods require the data to be populated before they can run. To facilitate this, the
                await keyword can be used in asynchronous methods to pause execution in that method until the Promise
                resolves. However, it is important to note that this does not block the callee method as asynchronous
                methods return a Promise, so the callee is free to continue executing if needed.</p>
            <p>In short, Vue’s reactive nature, coupled with JavaScript’s built-in asynchronous features, allows us to
                maximise the performance of the web app with little overhead code without idling, waiting for a backend
                response. </p>

            <h3>Vuex Store</h3>
            <p>Naturally, some data needs to persist between sessions. The <i>Vue store</i> (provided by the <a
                    href="https://next.vuex.vuejs.org">Vuex</a>
                library) is a mechanism allowing for persistent data storage.</p>
            <p>Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralised store
                for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a
                predictable fashion (What is Vuex? | Vuex, 2021).</p>
            <p>In the web app, Vuex is used to store the username of the logged-in user. This prevents the user from
                having to login whenever they switch pages and also allows them to remain logged in even after exiting
                the web app. The username is cleared from the store when the user manually logs out.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the store was used as an interface between the frontend components and the set of wrapper
                methods used to make axios API calls to the backend. Vuex is an extension of Vue.js, so the interaction
                between the two is natural and intuitive. Instead of the frontend directly making API calls, it
                interacts with the store; if the endpoints, or structure of messages changes, the frontend can remain
                the same – only the store needs to be modified.</p>
            <p>To reduce bandwidth, images were also cached in the Vuex store meaning they do not need to be continually
                fetched from elsewhere whenever the admin visits the website. It is important to note that if more
                images were to be added, the Vuex store would need to be cleared (which can be done
                programmatically).</p>

        <div class="web-app-section centred">
            <h3>Media Storage</h3>
            <p>The web app uses profile pictures to differentiate between app users assigned to an admin (in case they
                have the same name). Icons for each service are used to make the user experience more aesthetically
                pleasing.</p>
            <p>However, we decided we would not store these images in the cloud database as this would eat into our
                already limited IBM cloud storage quota (as we are on the free plan) which negatively affects the
                scalability of our solution – we would have to pay to increase our storage quota. Additionally, we would
                need to encode the images as binary text and then insert it; this would make database maintenance very
                difficult (e.g., we would not know if we’ve inserted the correct image as we cannot see it in the cloud
                database console).</p>
            <p>Instead, images were stored in a <a href="https://firebase.google.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google
                Firebase bucket</a> and
                accessed using Firebase’s JavaScript
                API. Accessing these images returns a download link which we can directly insert into an image tag in
                HTML. Images can then be easily modified as well as essentially providing us with more storage to work
                with for free.</p>
            <p>In the cloud database, these images are referenced by their filename which the web app uses when
                searching the Firebase bucket.</p>
            <p>Note that all images were converted into the <code>.webp</code> file format to
                reduce file sizes (and hence, bandwidth) with
                no loss in image quality. Images were also scaled down so their size was the maximum size the image
                would ever be when displayed on the website.</p>

        <h2>Android App</h2>
        <p>See implementation details for the app below.</p>
            <h3>Main Technologies</h3>
            <p>The app was programmed in Java using the Android Studio IDE and its built in features such as the
                Profiler.</p>
            <h3>Dependencies & Tools</h3>
            <p>We used several external libraries beyond the standard Java and Android libraries to help us develop and
                test our app. See the different sections below.</p>
            <h3>Android APIs</h3>
            <p>We made extensive use of the built in Android APIs for features such as searching contacts, making calls
                and providing notifications.</p>
            <p>This includes using the built-in Android speech recognition (which can be used offline for Android API Level 16 and above) and speech synthesis for our app. We used this as it was the simplest option
				given our app was native to Android. This provides the added benefit that as
                the Android speech
                recognition and speech synthesis improves, our app will automatically benefit, rather than having to maintatin and improve speech recognition 
				and synthesis ourselves.
                </p>
				<p>Generall speaking, using existing Android APIs saved us time from having to implement all the low level code ourselves. It also
				resulted in better code quality and ensured compatibility with different Android SDKs [see Compatibility Testing
				for more details]. The Android APIs are also well tested which is an important metric for quality assurance.</p></p>
            <h4>Built in SQLite 3 DB (For Alarms, Reminders and User Details)</h4>
            <p>We utilised the built in SQLite database that comes with Android for our Alarms and Reminders. We also
                used this to store a
                user's details after they connected to their admin. </p>
				<p> We utilised the localised storage as it is fast, convenient, reliable and raises no privacy concerns. It can now also act as a
                framework for developers who may wish to utilise the localised storage for their own features, some of which may be privacy sensitive.</p>
            <h4>Built in widgets</h4>
			<p> We utilised several built in widgets such as DatePicker, NumberPicker and more.</p>
            <p>These were used in some of our features. For example Alarms required widgets for choosing the date and time.
                and Timers required the NumberPicker widget. Reasons for using the built in widget are the same as for using Android
                APIs (see above). </p>
			<p>However, we accept a possible disadvantage of doing this which is that customisation of built in widgets is limited.
				Though we acknowledge that our app may benefit from custom widgets design wise, we did not have enough time to code and test these 
				(this may be an idea future teams can pick up on). </p>
            <h3>Java</h3>
            <h4>Java 13</h4>
            <p>We used Java 13 to program our app as it was the most up to date Java version and provided many standard,
                well tested, well maintained libraries which we could use.</p>
            <h4>Data Structures</h4>
            <p>We used many data structures in our app. The most notable one was HashMaps.
			</p>
			<p>	This was used to store key
                value pairs after parsing the JSON response
                from Ask Bob which would then be used by the AskBobResponseController to decide which method in
                MainController to call.</p>
			<p> We used HashMaps for their efficiency,
                as they provide O(1) time complexity for searching. This would ensure
                that we could respond to user requests more
                quickly. They also come with a variety of built in methods that were very useful, such as contains(),
                which was needed at several points to quickly
                check what sort of a request the user had made (Service API, Lookup etc). It
                also prevented the app from crashing
                due to NullPointerExceptions as we could check if the hashmap contained a particular key or not before
                asking for it through the get() method. Note that
                O(1) time complexity came into use here too.</p>
            <p> Aside from this, we used other data structures such as ArrayLists and Strings to pass data around our
                app appropriately. These data structures, along with HashMaps,
                came with a nice interface and Stream API methods which allowed us to easily peform required operations on these
				data structures without having to implement them ourselves. They were also easier to work with than raw
                data structures such as arrays due to their interface.</p>
            <p> We also used booleans, ints and other primitive data types. We used these when there was no need to use
                more complex data structures which made our
                app faster and less resource intensive.</p>
            <h4>Other Java Libraries</h4>
            <p>We used other standard Java libraries such as HttpUrlConnection (for connecting to the backend and Ask
                Bob servers) throughout the app. These standard libraries are also what allowed us to connect our app to the backend
				automatically. </p>
			<p>	Given that our backend server runs locally rather than on the cloud, the IP address would change for everyone 
				who ran the server. This created an issue as to how we could program our app to connect to the backend server on any network for everyone
				as the IP would change every time. We came up with a solution where our backend server broadcasts its IP address and the app picks it up 
				and stores this IP. This meant our app can dynamically connect to the local backend server on any network for everyone, without any input from the user.</p>
            <h3>Other Major Libraries</h3>
            <h4>Espresso</h4>
            <p>This library was used to write Instrumentation tests. Please refer to the testing section for further
                details.</p>
            <h4>Robolectric</h4>
            <p>This library was used to write unit/integration tests. Please refer to the testing section for further
                details. </p>
            <h4>Monkey</h4>
            <p>This library was used for stress testing. Please refer to the testing section for further details.</p>
            <h4>AndroidJUnit4Runner</h4>
            <p>This library was used to run Instrumentation tests. Please refer to the testing section for further
                details.</p>
            <h4>org.json</h4>
            <p>This library was used to parse the JSON response from the Ask Bob Server.</p>
            <h4>Backend and Ask Bob Servers</h4>
            <p>The app makes use of the Ask Bob server to send user requests and receive a JSON response which the app
                can use to decide which action to take.
                We also make use of our backend server
                to connect users with their admin and provide
                them with the functionality this entails such as their history.</p>
            <h3>Minor Libraries/Technology Used</h3>
            <h4>api.postcodes.io</h4>
            <p>This API is used to convert the user's latitude and longitude into a postcode for certain services such as Yell searches.</p>
            <h4>Play Services Location</h4>
            <p>This Google library is used as part of getting the user's latitude and longitude. </p>

        <h2>AskBob Integration</h2>
        <p>An integral part of our system is the Concierge Voice Assistant. This voice assistant is powered by the
            AskBob RESTful API which is deployed locally and will allow users to utilise the voice assistant within the
            app. This AskBob API receives the users command from the Concierge app in plain text. It then employee’s
            natural language processing to decode the intent behind command and then calls our Service API to retrieve
            the necessary information required to fulfil this request. This data is then returned to the app where the
            appropriate action can be triggered. </p>
        <p>This AskBob API was developed using Team 39’s AskBob NLP framework. This framework is based upon the Python
            library Rasa which is designed for building chatbots. Originally, we had been utilising Spacy to perform our
            natural language processing. In this case we designed and trained our own NLP Spacy model and were then
            running it as an API using the Python Library Flask. However, our clients requested that we integrate some
            of our services with the other 2 IBM groups (Team 39 and Team 38). As part of this integration, we were
            instructed to transition to the AskBob NLP framework for our voice assistant to ensure consistency across
            the FISE ecosystem. This involved transferring the services that we had already designed to the AskBob
            framework. </p>
        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>As mentioned above the AskBob API is intended to be deployed on a local network as specified in our MOSCOW
            requirements. The AskBob API is intended to receive a user’s command in plain text from the app which is
            acquired having the app perform speech recognition on the user’s verbal request. This request is then
            processed, and the appropriate data required to fulfil the request is retrieved from our service API. For
            the AskBob API to perform this, it is reliant on also having the service API running locally. </p>
        <h3>Adding Plugins</h3>
        <p>Services are added to the AskBob API in the form of plugins. Plugins are collections of services and the
            general Concierge plugin consists of three main files: an __init__.py file, an actions.py file and a
            config.json file. Within these files all the data required to implement a service is contained. </p>
        <h4>The <code>__init__.py</code> File</h4>
        <p>The purpose of the <code>__init__.py</code> file is to mark the plugin folder as a
            Python package. </p>
        <h4>The <code>config.json</code> File</h4>
        <p>The config file is used to define the skills within a given plugin. Skills refers to the to a specific
            service within the plugin. At its core a skill is comprised of an intent and an action. The intent can be
            understood as what the user is attempting to achieve, and the action is the process that is triggered by a
            specific intent. When defining an intent multiple sample commands must be provided as this is what the NLP
            model will train from. Actions on the other hand will be defined within the <code>actions.py</code>
            file. </p>
        <p>Additionally, certain skills may require data to be extracted from the user’s command. This data is referred
            to as entities and must also be defined in the config file. For more information on the syntax of a config
            file see <a href="https://github.com/UCL-COMP0016-2020-Team-39/AskBob" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Team
                39's GitHub repository</a>. </p>

        </div>
        <h4>The <code>actions.py</code> File</h4>
        <p>The actions.py file contains is where the actions for a given skill must be defined. Each action is defined
            as its own class. The code defined within this file will trigger when a given intent is recognised. For the
            majority of the Concierge an action will consist of extracting the necessary entities required by the
            service API and then placing a request to the specific service API endpoint to retrieve the necessary
            response. This response is then returned as a JSON data package with the following format: </p>

        <h2>Services API</h2>
        <p>The API service interaction is designed to be highly extensible with two methods to adding new services.</p>
        <div class="methods centred">
            <div class="json-schema-section">
                <h3>JSON Schema</h3>
                <p>This Java package greatly simplifies the extension of Concierge's already rich API interaction
                    ecosystem. It also allows
                    for new services to be added in a language-independent manner, providing a simple and intuitive, yet
                    powerful interface.</p>
                <p>Adding a new service assumes, and requires, prior knowledge of the API, its endpoints, required URL
                    parameters and
                    response structure. Prior knowledge about HTTP status codes (and what they mean) used by the API are
                    required for custom
                    exception reporting.
                <p>

                <p>For most services, the JSON schema should be sufficient to perform and parse API calls. However,
                    there are some limitations with the schema; to circumvent these, the service can be implemented as a
                    Java.</p>

                <p>See the example schema below (the API key has been omitted):</p>

                <p>The <code>message</code> field gives an indication as to what the natural language string returned
                    will be.</p>
                <p>More information on how this works and possible configurations can be found in our GitHub

            <div class="java-class-section">
                <h3>Java Class</h3>
                <p>Naturally, there are some limitations with string parsing (detailed in the wiki).</p>
                <p>To get around these limitations, a Java class can be used instead for more fine-grained control over
                    the JSON response object parsing.</p>
                <p>The new service will have to extend an abstract class, <code>AbstractServiceRequest</code>
                    shown below with some omissions:</p>

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Note that this is to extend the Service API interaction, without any NLP or inclusion in the FISE Concierge
            ecosystem.</p>
