        <h2>Testing Strategy</h2>
        <p>Given the scale of our given project, tests were critical to ensure the system worked correctly - the
            codebase was simply too large for us to have complete assurance without any tests.</p>
        <p>For each main component (described in the sections below) we used a subset of the following types of
            tests:</p>

        <h2>Admin Web App</h2>
        <p>Several different testing mechanisms were used to provide the assurance that the web app functioned correctly
            and provided a consistent user experience across different browsers and devices.</p>
        <div class="web-app-section centred">
            <h3>Technology Used</h3>
            <p>Testing a website can seem unintuitive at times but allowed us to uncover unknown issues with the web app
                that were not picked up during the initial implementation phase. </p>
            <p>We used the popular testing framework <a href="https://jestjs.io" rel="noopener"
                                                        target="_blank"><b>Jest</b></a> to test the web app. It
                allows us to mock components
                (without
                building them) and manually test individual components without building the entire application; we can
                therefore test specific pages and components without having to start at the homepage and sign in (or
                sign up) at the start of every single test. </p>
            <p>Human interaction e.g., button clicks, typing etc., can be accurately simulated using Jest making it a
                very versatile testing technology.</p>

        <div class="web-app-section centred">
            <h3>Unit Testing</h3>
            <p>Unit testings allows us to focus on and test components in isolation. Individual components (such as
                buttons, dropdowns and text inputs) were unit tested to ensure they were
                usable across many different contexts and provided the necessary functionality. These components were
                tested first to assert that the foundation of the web app was in working order. </p>
            <p>The components pass all the unit tests, and the report is included in the coverage report for the
                integration tests in the section below. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="web-app-section centred">
            <h3>Integration Testing</h3>
            <p>Integration testing was used to test multiple components together, with the backend.</p>
            <p>Given the nature of the web app, a sizeable portion of the system could not be tested in isolation.
                Integration testing was used with the backend to ensure that the web app communicated correctly with the
                database and provides assurance that the backend API, its endpoints (and their enclosing logic) were all
                in working order. A single test suite can therefore be used to assure that both the web app and backend
                (more specifically, the portion of the backend serving the web app) are functioning correctly. </p>
            <p>We can report that all integration tests passed, and the coverage report is shown below: </p>

                     tabindex="-1">
            </div>
            <p>It is important to note that some components could not be tested, some examples are given below: </p>
            <p>Some Vue components exist to reduce typing e.g., images – Jest does not allow the local filesystem to be
                used in tests meaning these components would throw an error if included in tests. </p>
            <ul class="centred">
                <li>Some code branches exist to assist with responsive design e.g., the grid shown for services in the
                    marketplace is implemented using several branches monitoring the window width – this cannot be
                    tested because of the limitations with the virtual DOM used by Jest outlined below.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The virtual DOM used by Jest does not implement the following: </p>
            <ul class="centred">
                <li>Programmatic scrolling.</li>
                <li>Navigation between pages (we can only test whether the method to change the page was called, but
                    not if it navigated to the correct page with the correct parameters).
                </li>
                <li>Window alerts and other popup messages.</li>
                <li>Page reloading.</li>
                <li>Setting a specific window size (width or height).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a result, the line and branch coverage is not as high as we had hoped.</p>
            <p>To circumvent these limitations with Jest, these components and aspects were tested manually during
                development; while on its own, line coverage is not the be-all-end-all for testing, manual testing still
                provides us with the assurance that the web app functions correctly. </p>
            <p>The total amount of unit and integration tests amounts to 139.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="web-app-section centred">
            <h3>Responsive Design Testing</h3>
            <p>It is expected that the admin web app will be used on several different browsers, on several different
                types of devices with different screen sizes, resolutions and pointer precisions. Because of this, it is
                better to display the responsive design test as a video (6 min) using Safari’s responsive design mode
                feature: </p>
            <div class="card centred">
                <div class="image-container noselect">
                    <div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:65.099%;">
                        <iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="100%" src="https://streamable.com/e/5yw2sd"
                                style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0;top:0;overflow:hidden;"
                                width="100%"></iframe>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>In short, the web app is responsive to any device size and mouse pointer precision (or lack thereof),
                achieved through <b>mobile-first</b> design. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="web-app-section centred">
            <h3>Compatibility Testing</h3>
            <p>Web apps do not need to be assessed for their platform-compatibility given they run on any platform with
                a browser with JavaScript enabled and an internet connection. Instead, this section describes the visual
                appearance of the web app on different browsers. </p>
            <p>As previously mentioned, the web app will be used on different browsers and we can confirm that it
                appears as expected in the four main browsers: Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox. </p>
            <p>During implementation, the tool <a href="https://caniuse.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CanIUse</a>
                was used to determine which CSS
                attributes were available
                on
                which browsers. It also gives a breakdown of the popularity of each browser, allowing us to decide
                whether it was worth supporting a particular browser that did not implement a CSS attribute. As a
                result, it is also likely the web app will appear the same on more obscure browsers. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="web-app-section centred">
            <h3>Performance Testing</h3>
            <p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google
                Lighthouse</a> was used to gauge the
                performance of the web app (among its accessibility and
                search
                engine optimisation); this is a simple, minimal-effort way of getting a performance report without
                requiring more advanced performance testing frameworks which are unnecessary given the project scale,
                deadline and expected load. </p>
            <p>The Lighthouse report for the Concierge web app for desktop (<b>left</b>) and mobile devices
                (<b>right</b>) is shown below: </p>

            <h3>User Acceptance Testing</h3>
            <p>To gain an unbiased overview and find out about potential improvements to the admin web app, we asked
                four

                <li><h5>Test Case 2</h5><br>

        <h2>Android App</h2>
        <p>Find details of the different types of tests we conducted to evaluate our app below.</p>
        <h3>Unit & Integration Testing</h3>
        <p>We wrote over 200 unit and integration tests achieving overall branch coverage of roughly 90%.
            These tested our app's functionality, from testing if buttons opened the correct
            activity to testing if we
            could parse AskBob responses correctly. </p>
        <p> Overall: </p>
        <div class="enlargeable">
            <span>Click to enlarge</span>
            <img src="assets/images/testing/app-unitTestCoverage-overall.png"/>

        <p> By Package: </p>

            <img src="assets/images/testing/app-unitTestCoverage-byPackage.png"/>
            <img src="assets/images/testing/app-unitTestCoverage-byPackage.png" tabindex="-1"/>
        </div>
        <p>Please note that the only class we didn't test was 'BuildConfig' which is dynamically generated at runtime
            and doesn't require testing.</p>
        <p>Unit and integration
            tests are important as they provide a quick way of locally testing whether our code works or not. It is more
            reliable than testing the app ourselves
            as metric such as branch coverage can help show us how much of our code exactly we are testing. It is also
            not ideal to test the app ourselves every time
            as it is time consuming and error prone. See screenshots below for overall branch coverage and branch
            coverage package by package
            (provided through Android Studio).</p>
        <p> Unit tests tested individual classes whereas the integration tests tested interactions
            between multiple classes. The majority
            of integration tests were limited to the MainController class and AskBobResponseController class since these
            are the two main classes which interact
            with other classes.</p>
        <p> Tests were split into different classes, each one corresponding to
            the class we were testing.
            The 'test' folder structure is identical to the structure of the 'main' folder which makes it easy to
            navigate and quickly find the test
            class we need. </p>
        <p> The tests were developed through TDD which helped us ensure the code we wrote was correct and minimal,
            saving us development time.
            The tests now act as a regression
            test suite, where if we add new code, we can run these tests to ensure there is no functionality leakage.
            This will be very useful for
            developers in the future who can use this when they add their own features to the app. </p>
        <p> As the tests utilised
            Android APIs and real time system
            features, we had to use a testing framework which would allow us to 'mock' these API and system calls.
            Therefore, we used Robolectric as our
            testing framework which provided powerful APIs to test our code. </p>
        <p> We chose Robolectric because it is robust,
            well tested, has a developer
            communnity and provided the APIs we needed to test our code. We did research alternatives such as Mockito
            and UI Automator but found Robolectric
            was the easiest to use and provided all the functonality we needed. </p>
        <p> However, a downside is that to run these tests, the targetSdkVersion
            must be set to 29 or lower, as Robolectric doesn't currently support Android SDK versions greater than 29.
            In no way does this hinder the reliability of the tests as all the code written is intended for devices with
            Android SDK
            version 16 or higher. However, it did mean that the targetSdkVersion has to be changed every time before
            running the tests
            which is inconvenient.</p>
        <p> Please note, aside from changing the
            targetSdkVersion, each test class has
            to be run individually as running all the tests in the 'test' package at once will cause them to fail - this
            is not because of our tests.
            It is an Android Studio bug [see Bugs under Evaluation].
            Also, Robolectric was used even for tests which did not use Android API calls. This is because using
            Robolectric provided a
            sandbox environment which could mock a real time Android setup, allowing us to test other features (such as
            making HTTP requests to our server) which we could not do in standard unit tests.</p>
        <h3>Instrumented Tests</h3>
        <p>Instrumented tests are UI tests which run on an emulator/device with AndroidJUnit4Runner. We wrote these integration and functional
            UI tests to automate user interaction, eg testing if the buttons all worked. </p>
        <p> We used the Espresso framework to write these
            tests, as recommended by Android.
            As well as using the standard features and APIs, we also used the 'assertions' feature to assert that key UI
            components such as the mic
            icon were present. </p>
        <p> Instrumented tests are important as they provide us with a way to test if the UI was working correctly which
            is essential for an app.
            They also allowed us to quickly test our changes to the UI to ensure we hadn't broken any of the existing
            UI. For example, if during
            UI redesign we accidentally deleted a key UI component, then the tests would point this out, quickly and
            precisely, saving us development
            time.</p>
        <p> As well as writing certain tests ourselves, we also used the built in
            Espress Test Recorder, which allowed us to perform actions on the device (such as clicking a button) and it
            would automatically convert these interactions into test code. </p>
        <p> This made writing tests much easier and quicker. It
            meant we didn't have to spend time
            writing tests ourselves or getting bogged down with learning how to use the framework from scratch as we
            could use this tools to automatically
            produce our tests easily in an intuitive manner. The chances of bugs in tests was also reduced.
            This is very important as a developer as we have very
            limited time, so tools which can effectively reduce test writing without affecting the quality of the tests
            are essential. </p>
        <p> However, a downside was that the tests produced by Espresso Test
            Recorded contained some deprecated
            methods. Therefore, after each test was produced, we manually replaced these deprecated
            methods ourselves with the proper,
            appropriate methods as required. Overall, we still saved a lot of time from having to learn the framework
            and
            writing the tests from scratch. </p>
        <p> Please note, that the tests fail if ANDROID_TEST_ORCHESTRATOR is used as executor under testOptions in the
            gradle file. This is again an
            Android Studio bug and nothing to do with us [please see Bugs under Evaluation]. The current gradle file
            already comments out use of
            ANDROID_TEST_ORCHESTRATOR. However, should a
            need arise for it in the future,
            it must be commented out before running the Instrumented tests. </p>
        <p> The combined use of unit tests and
            instrumented tests provided a powerful
            testing suite where unit tests would test the functionality and logic and the instrumentation tests
            would provide high level UI tests. </p>
        <h3>Stress Testing</h3>
        <p>It is an important quality assurance metric to stress test the app to ensure it can handle high pressure and
            volumes of input from the user. </p>
        <p> We used the Monkey framework for this. This was a form of automated testing where Monkey would randomly
            generate a number of events such as button clicks
            , text input, screen rotations and more and inject these into our app. The
            number of events to be generated could be specified
            by us through the terminal. We could also specify which types on inputs we wanted. However we left this to
            be the default (all types of input), as this
            would provide a comprehensive view of how much load our app could handle. </p>
        <p> We started off with 500 events,
            and doubled this every time (1000, 2000 etc). Our target was 5000 events to make the app crash. We are
            pleased to say that our app crashed at 16,000 events! Given that our app is to be used
            by elderly people and the nature of the
            app does not warrant regular, high volume user input (as a game might), we are highly confident that our app
            will be able to take the strain of regular
            user input without crashing. </p>
        <p> Please note that Monkey tests are not formally written or produced unlike our
            other tests - we have to run a command in the
            terminal every time we want to run a test. The command we used was "adb shell monkey -p
            com.example.fisev2concierge -v [number of events]".
            Please make sure the device is
            connected to your computer and that the computer
            has ABD installed and available.</p>
        <h3>Resource Usage Testing</h3>
        <p>Using the built in Android Studio Profiler, we were able to monitor the system resource usage of our app on
            a tablet (Octa Core, 4GB RAM, 64GB ROM). </p>
        <p> We performed
            a range of tasks on the app that we would expect our users to do, from making commands to adding reminders,
            for example. The average CPU usage during
            this time was less than 10% and the average RAM used was roughly 80MB. This is very good as it means our app
            uses minimal amount of system resources. Though we have not tested the app on low powered devices, this
            suggests
            that the app could run on such devices without changing the code. The Profiler settings were set to
            track low level method calls as well to ensure we got an accurate and deep reflection of the apps system
            resource usage. See screenshots of resource usage from the Profiler below.</p>
        <p>CPU usage during general usage, including using the voice assistant: </p>

            <img src="assets/images/testing/appRamUsage.png" tabindex="-1"/>
        </div>
        <p> Please note that Android only
            recommend doing formal speed testing specifically
            for tasks which use high amounts of the CPU. As our app doesn't use much CPU for any of the tasks, we did
            not conduct formal speed tests, though
            future developers may decide to do this as they add new functionality to the app. </p>
        <h3>Compatibility Testing</h3>
        <p> We want our app to be able to be used on a variety of devices, old and new. It was therefore important to
            make sure that it is compatible with
            different Android API levels. </p>
        <p> We did not conduct formal compatibility testing due to a lack of need. Android Studio itself tells us if we
            are using a
            system feature that is above our minSDK. This happened for setting an alarm notification, where Android
            Studio alerted us that
            the system call being used was above our minSDK. It then suggested a possible fix which we used. See the
            screenshot of this below. </p>
        <div class="enlargeable">
            <span>Click to enlarge</span>
            <img src="assets/images/testing/app-compatible-code.png"/>
            <img src="assets/images/testing/app-compatible-code.png" tabindex="-1"/>
        </div>
        <p> Furthermore, all our
            Android API calls are basic, such as calling and messaging. We also do not interact with low level system
            features
            or the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Where possible, we also tried to use libraries which had been
            tested for backward compatibility.
            For instance, Google's Play Services (used to obtain the user's latitude and longitude) have been tested to
            ensure backward compatibility
            with Android SDKs up to 4.1 (API Level 16, which is also our minSDK). We therefore felt that formal
            compatibility testig was not necessary at this stage.
            It should also be noted that we tested the app on a tablet which ran Android SDK 8 (which is nearly 4 years
            old) and on a phone running the newer
            Android SDK and both worked without issue.
        </p>
        <h3>User Acceptance Testing</h3>
        <p>We asked some elderly people that we know to test our app and provide us with feedback.</p>
		<p>The app has a lot of features so we split our test cases into different parts. </p>
		<p>The first part was using the voice assistant along with all the available services (APIs and device services). </p>
		<p>The second part was getting them to connect to the admin and reuse some of the APIs.</p>
		<p>The third part was using the other features (Alarms, Reminders and Timers). </p>
		<p>The fourth part was just navigating to all the different pages and assessing the UI.</p>
		<p>The idea was to test the design, functionality and ease of use of our app with our test users.</p>
		<h4>Phase One</h4>
		<p>Users were given phrases for the different services and asked to use them with our voice assistant. We noted how many successes and failures there were and then asked for feedback at the end.</p>

<h4>Phase Two</h4>
<p>We setup an admin and made accounts for all the users and added their favourite service from Phase 1 to their account.
We then asked the users to use their favourite service and least favourite service (which should be rejected by the VA since it hasn’t been added to their account) and to check their history for the service.
Feedback was then collected which can be seen below.</p>

<p>Overall, the feedback was very positive and exactly what we hoped the users would feel. </p>
<p>We will take on board the negative points. 
All of these are small issues which can easily be resolved in the future. 
They occurred mainly due to lack of time. For example, if we had more time, 
we could implement custom number pickers with larger size.</p> <p> As a proof of concept, this is very encouraging. </p>

        <h2>AskBob Integration</h2>
        <p>Testing the AskBob API presented certain challenges which limited the depth at
            which it could be tested. However, we were still able to test the AskBob APIs
            to a certain extent. </p>
        <p>To do this we used the Python testing library <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/" rel="noopener"
                                                            target="_blank"><b>PyTest</b></a>.
            This library allows us to easily create tests written in Python which are easy to
            read and understand. </p>

            <h3>Unit Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Due to the nature API, we found that unit testing was not feasible.
                This is caused by the way the AskBob is written due to the fact it utilises RASA.
                With RASA it is very difficult to separate the components of a chat bot (or in our
                case a voice assistant) as the code behind it is very intertwined. For example, in
                our case we were unable to separate the intent recognition of AskBob from the action’s
                component. This meant that performing unit tests was not possible. </p>

            <p>

                This is caused by the way the AskBob is written due to the fact it utilises RASA.

                component. This meant that performing unit tests was not possible. </p>
            <p>These tests were organised based on which specific plugins they are intended to test.
                Within these plugins all branches of the actions code that are feasibly accessible by a
                user are explored. This provides mostly completely branch coverage with a few exceptions
                where a branch is realistically unreachable as in certain cases the service APIs will
                provide a default response. Additionally, each service is tested with a variety of phrasings
                to ensure the robustness of the natural language processing of the AskBob API. </p>
            <p>One thing to note is that due to the discrepancies that may arise between training sessions
                of the NLP model behind the AskBob API there exists a change that a minute amount of these
                tests will fail. These will vary between different instances of the AskBob API. </p>

            <h3>Performance Testing</h3>
            <p>Similarly, to the unit tests we found ourselves unable to perform any meaningful performance
                testing on the AskBob API. This is in large part due to the Concierge Service API that the
                AskBob API utilises to retrieve the data required for a given request. Since the Concierge
                Service API is comprised of a collection of APIs it will have varying degrees of performance.
                This is caused by the locations in which these APIs are hosted as that will cause different
                amounts of latency. </p>

        <h2>Services API</h2>
        <p>Because our API interaction used external APIs with live information, we had no way of accurately testing
            they were functioning correctly - the information returned by each API is likely to change between test
            runs.
            Additionally, some services return random and/or location/time dependent information; this means
            we cannot write a test suite that is consistent across different time periods and locations.</p>
        <p>As a result, we assumed these APIs were tested by their respective developers and elected to only test the
            JSON schema system and the response parsing.</p>
        <p>The programmer-friendly testing framework for Java and the JVM (JUnit 5, 2021) <a
                href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit</a>
            was used to write the integration tests for the API plugin system.</p>

        </div>
        <p>We wrote unit tests for different schemas (both valid and malformed) for different APIs as well as testing
            the response parser with different JSON response objects.</p>
        <p>All tests pass, providing us with the assurance that we can use our API plugin system to represent any API as
            a JSON schema and turn the API response into a natural language string.</p>

        <h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
        <p>A continuous integration provides us with some assurance that we are breaking existing code in our system
            when pushing changes to our repository.</p>
        <p>Continuous integration also promotes the development of testable code, of a higher quality.</p>
        <p>We did not feel the need to go for a fully-fledged continuous integration suite like Travis CI as GitHub
            actions (since our repository is already on GitHub) was sufficient for our use case.</p>
        <p>GitHub actions run tasks on every push or pull request and we used this to run all of our tests after each
            repository update.</p>
        <p>A <code>develop</code>
            branch was used to introduce new features and manually merged to the <code>main</code>
            branch if it did not introduce any new issues. </p>
        <p>If we worked in much larger groups, we would have set up the workflow to automatically merge pull requests -
            this feature is unnecessary for our group size.</p>
        <p>Below is the (recent) history of the CI workflow runs</p>
