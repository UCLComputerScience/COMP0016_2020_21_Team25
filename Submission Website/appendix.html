        <h2>Deployment Manual</h2>
        <p>See the following guides for deploying the admin web app and the Android app. Both have been containerised to
            greatly simplify the build process and provide platform independency where possible. </p>
        <div class="deployment-guide centred">
            <div class="web-app-deployment">
                <h3>Admin Web App</h3>
                <p>See instructions for deploying the admin web app.</p>
                <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
                <p>You will need a (relatively recent) browser that allows JavaScript - more information on supported
                    browsers can be found in the <a
                            href="https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team25/tree/main/Admin%20Site/package.json#L69"><code>package.json</code></a>
                    file.</p>
                <p>The web app is hosted at <a href="https://fise-concierge.web.app" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fise-concierge.web.app</a>.
                    However, due to security restrictions, the backend does not
                    work on Safari, this means you will need to serve the web app locally.</p>
                <p>If you would like to serve the web app locally or get started with development, you will need the
                    additional prerequisites:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://nodejs.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Node.js</a> - Package manager</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">npm</a> - This should
                        come with your Node installation.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>You will also need to clone the source code from our <a
                        href="https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team25">GitHub repository.</a
                ></p>

                <p>The backend is containerised with <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" rel="noopener"
                                                        target="_blank">Docker</a> to make
                    for simple and fast deployment.</p>

                <h4>Installation</h4>

                <p>The following installation steps are only required if you would like to serve the web app locally. If
                    using the hosted web app, you can skip this section.
                <p>
                <p>You will need to clone our GitHub repository, running the following command in a directory of your
                    choice: </p>
                <code class="bash-cmd">git clone
                    https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team25.git</code>
                <p>Once you have the source code, to install the necessary dependencies using the
                    following terminal command:</p>
                <code class="bash-cmd">npm install</code>
                <br>


                <h4>Deployment</h4>
                <div class="backend-deployment">
                    <p>To start the backend, first ensure no <code>localhost</code> service is currently running on port
                        <code>8100</code>.</p>
                    <p>Next, open a terminal window and navigate to the "Backend" directory. If you cloned the entire
                        repository and are in the topmost directory, you can use the following command:</p>
                    <code class="bash-cmd">cd Backend</code>
                    <p>The backend can then be built using the following terminal command:</p>
                    <code class="bash-cmd">docker build --tag backend .</code>
                    <p>And to then start the backend application (whilst in the "Backend" directory):</p>
                    <code class="bash-cmd">docker run --rm -it -p 8100:8100 backend backend</code>
                    <p>It is recommended that you always start the backend before the web application.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="web-app-start">
                    <p>If you are <b>not</b> serving the web app locally, you can just head over to <a
                            href="https://fise-concierge.web.app"
                            rel="noopener"
                            target="_blank">fise-concierge.web.app</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Otherwise, navigate to the "Admin Site" directory with:</p>
                    <code class="bash-cmd">cd ..; cd "Admin Site"</code>
                    <p>And then:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To start the web app in development mode, with verbose debugging information:
                            <br><code class="bash-cmd">npm run-script dev:start</code></li>
                        <li>To start the web app in production mode, with all the necessary optimisations performed:
                            <br><code class="bash-cmd">npm start</code></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h4>Testing</h4>
                <p>Note that when running any tests, the backend must still be started.</p>

                <p>To run the pre-defined tests:</p>
                <code class="bash-cmd">npm run-script test:noserver</code>

                <p>The backend can be started automatically, so you do not need to manually start the backend. </p>
                <code class="bash-cmd">npm test</code>

                <p>However, this starts up and shuts down the backend server on each run - this approach is intended to
                    be used for automated build systems.</p>

                <p>A coverage report can be generated using:</p>
                <code class="bash-cmd">npm run-script coverage:noserver</code>

                <p>And to generate a coverage report, whilst also automatically running the backend:</p>
                <code class="bash-cmd">npm run-script coverage</code>

            <div class="v-divider"></div>
            <div class="android-app-deployment">
                <h3>Android App</h3>
                <p>See instructions for deploying the Android app.</p>
                <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
                <p>You will need an Android device running an Android API level of at least 16 (<b>Jellybean 4.1.x</b>)
                    and a separate computer or
                    laptop to run the backend to serve the app.</p>

                <p>The backend, the AskBob (Team 39) NLP server and service API interaction are all containerised
                    meaning the following prerequisites are also required:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" rel="noopener"
                           target="_blank">Docker</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/" rel="noopener"
                           target="_blank">docker-compose</a></li>

                </ul>

                <p>For development, you will also need <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio"
                                                          rel="noopener norefferer" target="_blank">Android
                    Studio</a>.</p>

                <p>It is important to note that Concierge is intended to be used in <b>private networks only.</b></p>

                <h4>Installation</h4>
                <p>The APK file for the Android app can be found <a
                        href="https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zcabasy_ucl_ac_uk/EoxETmOVQ8JGhfXjyaqTgp4BnNrG9aYGqlXwCrODMDtB4A?e=xEE6WN"

                        target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>

                <p>You will need to clone our GitHub repository, running the following command in a directory of your
                    choice: </p>
                <code class="bash-cmd">git clone
                    https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team25.git</code>

                <h4>Deployment</h4>
                <p>To start the backend, the AskBob (Team 39) NLP server and service API interaction:</p>
                <code class="bash-cmd">docker-compose up</code>

                <p>The final step is the run the APK file on your Android device. Instructions on how to do so can be
                    found <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/install-apk-on-android-4177185" rel="noopener norefferrer"
                             target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <h4>Testing</h4>
                <p>The following information assumes you have cloned the repository and have Android Studio
                    installed.</p>
                <p>The repository contains a regression test suite developed through TDD which you can use to ensure
                    there is no functionality leakage and to which you can add your own tests for your code. The tests
                    under androidTest package are instrumented tests which run on a device/emulator. The tests under
                    test package are unit tests which run on the JVM. See important notes for both below.
                </p>
                <p>Instrumented tests - these tests were written using the Espresso framework and provide UI tests hence
                    only contain tests for classes corresponding to an activity. Please note, for these tests to run,
                    line 19 in the <code>build.gradle</code> file had to be commented out as these tests fail when using
                    <code>ANDROID_TEST_ORCHESTRATOR</code> (nothing to do with our tests, more of an Android Studio
                    bug).</p>
                <p>Unit tests - these tests were written using the Robolectric framework and test the actual logic and
                    code of the app. There are two important points to note here:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To run these tests, the <code>targetSdkVersion</code> under <code>defaultConfig</code> under
                        android must be
                        set to <b>29</b> or lower as Robolectric framework does not currently support any Android SDK
                        versions greater than
                        29. In no way does this hinder the reliability of the tests as all the code written is intended
                        for devices with Android SDK version 16 or higher as mentioned above.
                    </li>
                    <li>All the tests cannot be run in one go (i.e., you cannot right click on the test package and
                        select
                        <code>'Run Tests in 'fisev2concierge''</code>) as for some reason this causes the tests to fail.
                        Again, this
                        has nothing to do with our tests, rather it is an Android Studio issue. Instead, you must run
                        each test class individually.
                    </li>
                </ul>
